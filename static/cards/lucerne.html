            <p class="card-text">This charming city in central Switzerland is situated on the shores of Lake Lucerne, with a backdrop of snow-capped mountains. You can stroll along the Chapel Bridge, a wooden bridge with painted panels that dates back to the 14th century, visit the Lion Monument, a carved stone lion that commemorates the Swiss soldiers who died during the French Revolution, and explore the Old Town, which has many colourful buildings and squares. You can also take a boat ride on the lake or a cable car up to Mount Pilatus or Mount Rigi for panoramic views.</p>
