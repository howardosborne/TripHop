            <p class="card-text">The second-largest city in Switzerland is a cosmopolitan hub of culture, diplomacy, and innovation. It is home to the headquarters of many international organisations, such as the United Nations and the Red Cross. You can visit the Jet d'Eau, a huge fountain that shoots water 140m into the air, the Cathedral of St. Pierre, where John Calvin preached during the Reformation, and the Patek Philippe Museum, which showcases the history and craftsmanship of Swiss watchmaking. Geneva is also a gateway to the nearby vineyards and mountains of France.</p>
