            <p class="card-text">Lübeck is a beautiful city in northern Germany with a rich medieval history and architecture that is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Holsten Gate is the city's landmark and a remnant of the old fortifications. The old town is full of charming gabled houses, churches and courtyards. It’s also the home of marzipan, a sweet treat made from almonds and sugar that comes in many shapes and flavours. Lübeck is also an ideal starting point for exploring the Baltic Sea coast. The city is located on the Trave, which flows about 20 kilometres further into the Baltic Sea. From here you can go on day trips on historic ships or visit the nearby beaches and seaside resorts.</p>
