    <p class="card-text">Back in the 8th Century, this was the centre of Europe. Now it’s a comfortable spa town near the border with Belgium and the Netherlands where you can get pampered at Carolus Thermen, a modern spa complex with indoor and outdoor pools and saunas after a visit to Charlemagne’s shrine at Aachen Cathedral. It’s also the place to try Aachener Printen - its famous gingerbread-like cookies.
