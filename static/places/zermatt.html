            <p class="card-text">This car-free resort town at the foot of Matterhorn is a paradise for skiers and hikers alike. You can take a cogwheel train up to Gornergrat, where you can enjoy a stunning view of Matterhorn and 28 other peaks over 4000m (13,123ft). You can also visit the Matterhorn Museum, which tells the story of the first ascent of the iconic mountain in 1865 and displays artefacts from that expedition. Zermatt is also known for its gastronomy and nightlife, with many restaurants and bars to choose from</p>
