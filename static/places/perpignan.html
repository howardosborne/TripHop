	Perpignan is home to about 120,000 people, and has two rivers flowing through it; with the TÃªt to the north, and the Basse through the centre. Once the continental capital of the Kingdom of Majorca, Perpignan has been an economical and educational centre for centuries, and this is evident in its architecture.
