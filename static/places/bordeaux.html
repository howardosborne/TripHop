        Bordeaux, resting on the banks of the Garonne is the global capital of wine and it would be rude not to get straight to the point and pay a visit to La Cité du Vin where you can learn about how the giggle-juice is made and maybe do some tasting?

And after a tipple or two, perhaps the next stop ought to be the nearby Halles de Bacalan for a wide selection of tasty grub. Why not try a local canelé - a rum and vanilla flavoured pastry with a custard centre and caramelised crust - yum.

For hundreds of years, the wine trade brought Bordeaux wealth in abundance which is tastefully on display in the city's collection of buildings, particularly along a moon-shaped bend in the river known as Port de la Lune (listed by UNESCO for it's' outstanding urban and architectural ensemble created in the age of Enlighenment'). Indeed, Bordeaux has more protected buildings than any other French city apart from Paris, which the canny Bordelais have cleverly accentuated with more modern features like the water mirror. 

And to complement the high-end wines and architecture, how about taking in some high-brow opera, or ballet at the Opera House where tickets start at 8 euros? 

Bordeaux has had more sobering periods of history, as evidenced by the U-boat submarine base, which proved too difficult to destroy after the war and now stands as a permanent reminder. However, the cavernous interiors have been turned into an opportunity for a more creative and imaginative use and now house Les Bassins des Lumières - the largest fixed multimedia installation in the world. To get there take Tram C to Raveziès and then n°9 bus. 

If you fancy a day trip to the beach, why not hop on a train to Arcachon (40 minutes) and visit the Dune du Pilat, Europe's highest sand dune.

Highlights
Do some wine tasting (and maybe learn a thing or two) at La Cité du Vin, or if you want to try some wine at source you could hire a bike and take this 9km route which includes visits to two urban vineyards

Stroll around Port de la Lune and on to the nearby Miroir d'Eau (water mirror), the world's largest reflecting pool, which lies in front of the Place de la Bourse. (The mirror also has an ingenious system for ejecting a mist effect every 20 minutes or so)

Visit the Gothic cathedral of St-André and its 50m high be-gargoyled belfry where you can get a some great view of the city

See the 'too big to destroy' wartime submarine base that's been turned into the largest fixed multimedia installation in the world.

Station stroll ideas
If you have some time free waiting for a train, why not go for a wander?

Tourist info have created a set of maps and brochures for download, which you can get here and some suggested walks here. You could also have a go at the app for your phone.

Note: The station is around 2km from the most popular sights, so you might want to take a tram (lines c or d). You can get a tram map here.

However if you just want to stride out from the station, I've also created a downloadable PDF with accompanying google map, which will give you a feel for the place and take in the sights. 

Guided tours
Tourist info provide details of a couple of tours which start at the tourist information office here.

There is also a greeter network here - a chance to meet locals in their town.
