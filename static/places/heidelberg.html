    <p class="card-text">The city of Heidelberg is one of the most romantic cities in Germany, thanks to its picturesque setting on the Neckar river and its historic castle. You can stroll along the Old Bridge, visit the Heidelberg Castle ruins and gardens, admire the Old Town Hall and the Church of the Holy Spirit, and soak up the academic atmosphere at Heidelberg University, Germany's oldest university.
