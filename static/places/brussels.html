            <p class="card-text">As the capital of Belgium and the European Union, Brussels is the place where decisions get made - or at least talk about getting made and you can find out more about that with a wander over to the Parlamentarium. Alternatively, why not take a stroll to the Grand Place, the iconic Atomium, or the colourful Comic Strip Museum via the Manneken Pis. You can also fill your tummy in some of the best chocolate, waffles, fries, and beer in the world.</p>
