    <p class="card-text">The capital city of Switzerland is a UNESCO World Heritage site, with a medieval Old Town that features 6km (3.7 miles) of covered arcades, colourful fountains, and historic buildings. You can visit the Einstein-Haus, where the genius developed his theory of relativity, the Kunsthaus, which has an outstanding fine arts collection, and the Zentrum Paul Klee, a modern museum dedicated to the Swiss painter. Bern is also surrounded by wooded hills and the turquoise Aare river, which you can swim in during summer.
