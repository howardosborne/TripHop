        Figueres is the home of Salvador Dalí and where you can visit his extraordinary egg and bread festooned Dalí Theatre-Museum. It's also where you'll find Europe's largest fortress - the Castle of Sant Ferran and a couple of specialty museums, including the Empordà Museum (local and regional cultural heritage) and Catalan Toy Museum which has a section devoted to, you guessed it - Dalí's childhood...

But being here is also a chance to sample life in a Catalan town away from the bustle of Barcelona and only a few minutes from France.If you want to pick up local produce, or just gaze at what will be served in restaurants that evening, there's a market on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays between the Plaça del Gra to the Plaça Catalunya.

Incidentally, Figueres is also the birthplace of of Narcís Monturiol, inventor of the first successful machine-powered submarine whose remarkable story I explored during my visit to Cadaqués, which by some bizarre symmetry is also where you can visit Dalí's beloved seaside home and studio.
