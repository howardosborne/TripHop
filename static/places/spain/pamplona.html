        Pamplona, Iruña in Basque, is the historic capital of the Kingdom of Navarre which straddled Spain and France.

It's said that in 303 AD, the life of Saint Fermín came to a grisly end by being dragged through the streets with angry bulls running after him. And in July each year, one million people come to Pamplona and try and recreate that event. At the latest count, 16 people have been successful.

The non-stop nine-day fiesta became world famous after Ernest Hemingway popularised it in his novel The Sun Also Rises. Why not come for a drink at one of Hemingway's haunts, such as the Iruña Café which is just a short stagger from La Perla Hotel.

If you want to people watch, you can rely on the steady stream of pilgrims who pass through the town on their way to Santiago de Compostela. Most follow the Camino Frances and start in Saint Jean Pied-de-Port calling in at Roncesvalles on the way.

Food is a big deal, all bars are lined up with inexpensive tasty pinxos for you to try. Hot tip: ask for their speciality, which may not be on display, and their kitchen will rustle up the finest thing they have on offer.

If you want to take the gastronomic experience to another level, why not take have a browse first at this or this. 

Later, why not have a stroll along the 5km of city walls or visit the cathedral?
