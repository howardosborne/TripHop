    <p class="card-text">Madrid, capital of Spain and former centre of a vast new-world empire has accumulated a wealth of art and architecture that should tickle even the most jaded of travellers.
What better place to start than in the Golden Triangle of Art - the three world class museums of the Prado, Reina Sof�a and Thyssen-Bornemisza. And if you want to pace yourself, why not break up your museum visits with a paseo through the grand (and neat) space of El Retiro Park? See if you can find the statue of Lucifer. Need a clue? It stands at 666 meters above sea level. This park along with Paseo del Prado boulevard has been added to UNESCO's World Heritage List.
If you want bigger green spaces and bigger views, you could go to the other side of the Royal Palace to the former hunting grounds of the Casa de Campo. Hop on a telef�rico cable car for a bird's eye view. But as you go past the Royal Palace, don't expect the King and Queen to invite you in for a 'tapa and ca�a' as they don't live there anymore.
A visit to The Temple of Debod will transport you back to ancient Egypt. This temple was moved here stone-by-stone from upper Egypt and donated in thanks for the help with conservation work at Abu Simbel.
Madrid is proudly touted as Spain's non-stop capital of food, fashion and nightlife. And if you want to put all three to the test, but rolled in to one, why not visit these stylish bars and restaurants as the sunsets? Otherwise, just join the evening marcha - a throng of people hopping from bar to bar in search of tapas and working up an appetite ready for dinner as midnight approaches.
