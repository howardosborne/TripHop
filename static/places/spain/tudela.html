        With arid desert to the north and lush market gardens to the south, Tudela is quite unlike the rest of Navarre. For a start, you can leave behind your Basque dictionary as Spanish is the only official language here.

But the other Navarrese won't hold that against them, at least not all the time they produce top quality veg and in particular, ugly tomatoes. Feo de Tudela tomatoes are highly prized among connoisseurs who know that beauty is more than skin deep and come to the tomato festival at the end of August to taste that year's crop.
