        Portbou is a pleasantly sleepy border town and port and is the first place you'll come to when coming from France if you have taken the Paris - Cerbere sleeper, or not come on the high-speed trainline.

The town was a hive of activity in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries with the coming of the railways and in particular, the incompatibility of Spanish and French railway tracks. The different gauges meant that people had time to wait at the station, which they used by visiting the town.

Now high-speed trains take a different route into Spain, so this town has been able to kick-back and chill. However, it does have a steady stream of visitors from France who come to stock up on sin-taxed products like cigarettes, alcohol and perfume.

The dominance of local slate gives the town a vague feeling of being in North Wales, except you don't turn blue when you go in the sea.

The mass exodus of people through here at the end of the Spanish Civil War and then the flow of Jewish and other vulnerable people with the fall of France in the Second World War has been commemorated at the border and a poignant memorial to Walter Benjamin is by the graveyard.	</p>
