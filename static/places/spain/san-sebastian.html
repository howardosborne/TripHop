        Being just 20km from the French border, San Sebastian (Donostia in Basque) is an ideal hop off when travelling to Spain. Where better to top up your tan, fill up your tummy and empty your wallet in this seductively urbane resort?

Probably the most difficult decision you will have to make here is which of the beaches to choose from?

To the west in La Concha bay the gentle sandy slopes make paddling a pleasure even for the most senior of citizens who come here to while away their twilight years and take surprisingly speedy paseos along the water's edge.

A decidedly younger set make for Zurriola beach to the East where there are bigger waves - ideal for a spot of surfing.

Food plays a big part here. The old town to the West is great if you want tasty pinxos side-by-side with other tourists. Over in the East you are more likely to hear locals asking for today's specialities. You can download an app to find the best pinxos here.
