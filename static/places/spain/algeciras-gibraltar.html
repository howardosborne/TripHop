        The historic and forever functional Gibraltar is quite unique and a fitting endpoint for any journey from Blighty. Make sure to savour the experience of walking across the runway (following the green cross code at the pedestrian lights).

As gateway to the Mediterranean, Gibraltar has long been of strategic importance and indeed military history is everywhere.. A trip to the cemetery is worthwhile if only to see the simple headstones of Trafalgar war graves.

The outcrop's historical significance, however, extends further back into the mists of time with the Gorham's Cave Complex believed to be one of the last known habitations of Neanderthals in Europe. Due to the richness of the finds UNESCO has listed its four caves for their contribution to the understanding of human history.

The cosy nature of being in one of the most densely populated places on earth means that if you want a breather it's worth taking a trip to the Top of the Rock and getting some prime views of the Strait and Africa. The Rock is also home to the (in)famous population of tailless Barbary macaques.

Getting to Gibraltar from Madrid means going via the port of Algeciras which is worth a wander and it's where you can catch a ferry to Spanish Ceuta in Africa if you can't resist the pull south. Alternatively, you could catch a bus to Tarifa and pop over to Tangiers.
