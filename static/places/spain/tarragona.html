      <p class="card-text">Just one hour from Barcelona is the old Roman city of Tarraco (now Tarragona) with is impressively situated amphitheatre.
Tarragona seems to effortlessly juggle being both a UNESCO-listed tourist destination and a busy port with all the associated industry.
Ancient history can feel remote from our times, and some Roman sites are a bit dry. However, here the Roman past is brought to life through the smallest (and saddest) of Tarragona's many finds. A children's doll was found in the grave of a four or five-year-old girl. The telling of this story along with all the other finds at the Archaeological Museum, makes the distant past feel much closer.
