        Córdoba's Mezquita (Great Mosque) with it's nested cathedral is reason enough to come here on its own, but there's plenty else to see and do in this ancient Andalusian city.

The fortified palace of Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos is a sumptuous glimpse into the world of the Christian (re)conquerors and their reuse of the what was left behind by their Moorish and Roman predecessors. While exploring the UNESCO listed historic centre, why not visit the Synagogue, which was probably built just for a single family or other small group, but contains intricate stucco work. A wander to the Roman bridge also fills in more clues to the layered history of the town.

An 8km bus ride away is the Medina Azahara which is Spain’s largest archaeological site on what had (briefly) been a huge palace complex and its story is retold well on site (in English).

Córdoba gets very hot in summer, so spring is an ideal time to come when it is cooler and the jasmine and orange trees are in full bloom. May is also fiesta time with May Crosses, the 'Battle of Flowers' street parade, 'Railings and Balconies' competition, Fiesta of Patios and ending with the Feria de Córdoba.

If your looking for tapas, the historic quarter and the neighbourhoods of San Lorenzo, San Andrés and Santa Marina are good places to try. You might want to try salmorejo (cold tomato soup), flamenquín (pork roll fried in breadcrumbs), aubergines with honey and mazamorra (cold almond soup).
