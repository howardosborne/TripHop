        Puigcerdà, capital of the Spanish lower Cerdaña region of the Pyrenees, has long been a getaway for Barcelonans looking for (and often needing) a breath of fresh air. From spring until autumn, people tromp through in their hiking boots. And in the winter, it's just a stone's throw from the ski slopes of La Molina.

Built on a hill, a funicular railway takes you from the train station to the quaint town above, which incidentally is a setting for 'The Angels Game' by Spanish Carlos Ruiz Zafón and there's a short trail you can follow. 

Being on the border with France and on the railway line, it's also a nice little stop-off between Spain and France.
