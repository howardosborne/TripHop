        The Catalan city of Girona is the smart choice for those who have found Barcelona just a bit too much...Founded by the Romans, the old town has a strong medieval feel with its looming gothic Cathedral which proved an ideal backdrop for Game of Thrones. 

Visiting the Arab Baths is a reminder of Girona's more complicated past, as is El Call, the former Jewish Quarter which is one of the best preserved in Spain. There's a Museum of Jewish History where you can learn more about it.

Walking the restored city walls gives you great views of the city with the Pyrenees forming a backdrop, and at the west end is the picturesque Monestir de Sant Pere de Galligants where you will find the Museu d'Arqueologia de Catalunya. Views of the River Onyar, and the pretty painted houses that back on to it, are also some of the most photographed, especially the Casa Masó - home of Girona's favourite architect, Rafael Masó. Two of his best works (Farinera Teixidor and La Punxa) are near the railway station.

As for food and drink, there are great places to eat all over town, but one quirky place is Federal which was created on the concept of being in a remote part of Australia...For atmosphere, the Plaça de la Independència has a nice hubbub in the evenings thanks to being an enclosed square. But whatever you eat make sure leave some space for Girona's local super-charged custard doughnut, the xuixo - patisseries all over town sell them.

If you want to be here for a festival, then you can come pretty much any time you like as there are festivals most months.
