<p class="card-text" >With around 20 million tourists per year, Barcelona is on the popular side...But it's with good reason. It's a sophisticated beach-side party town with world class architecture and there's always a festival of some sort on. </p>
<p class="card-text" >Barcelona's architectural delights span the last two millennia, from the labyrinth of narrow cobbled streets and piazza's of the Gothic Quarter (which still bear traces of ancient Roman Barcino), to the organic sculptural Modernist pieces of Gaud�. However, you're unlikely to get the works of Gaud� all to yourself, so you'll be have to be content to share (especially in July and August). </p>
<p class="card-text" >Whatever time of year you visit, sight-seeing is a hungry business and thankfully Barcelona has a mouth-watering dining and drinking scene with excellent tapas bars to be found all over the city .</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p class="card-text" >Pay homage to the city's Gaud� masterpieces - Sagrada Familia (awe-inspiring church not to be missed), Parc G�ell (unique and colourful urban ornamental park), Casa Batll� and La Pedrera (two wavy buildings which started off as residential apartment blocks)</p>
<p class="card-text" >Stroll around the Gothic Quarter (Barri Gotic) where you'll also find Barcelona's beautiful Gothic cathedral</p>
<p class="card-text" >Visit Parc de Montj�ic - big urban park with fortress topped hill that can be reached by cable car. The park also contains the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya - MNAC (showcasing Catalan art up to the 1940s), Fundaci� Joan Mir� (museum founded by the artist himself), Olympic stadium (1992 games) and the popular magic fountain</p>
