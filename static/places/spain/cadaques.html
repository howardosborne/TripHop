        Cadaqués is a remote town on the Cap de Creus peninsula and is a hot spot for people who want to visit the Cap de Creus Natural Park and Salvador Dalí's home in neighbouring Portlligat.

The narrow cobbled streets lined by whitewashed houses are well worth a wander, as is the church of Santa María which was paid for by fishermen working overtime after it had been burned down by pirates. Now the church hosts the annual International Music Festival in July.
