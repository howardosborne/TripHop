	Located between a lagoon and the Med and connecting the Canal du Midi to the sea, this southern French working port is a great place to get seafood and sea views. Throughout the summer you can also catch some water-jousting where old-style lifeboats (barque de sauvetage) with multiple oarsmen and one jouster charge at each other and try to unseat their opponent.
