    <p class="card-text">The second-largest city in Austria, Graz is a mix of old and new. You can marvel at the medieval buildings and monuments in the Old Town, such as the Styrian Armoury or the Clock Tower, or admire the modern architecture and design of the Kunsthaus or the Murinsel. Graz is also known for its culinary delights, especially its pumpkin seed oil and chocolate. The train journey from Vienna to Graz takes you through the Semmering railway, a spectacular UNESCO World Heritage Site that showcases the engineering and landscape of Austria.
