            <p class="card-text">Capital of the Hargita province on the edge of the eastern Carpathians, this is a good place to get a better understanding of the ethnic complexity of Transylvania. Why not visit the Csiki Szekely Muzeum in the Mik√≥ Castle which is dedicated to Szekler culture and traditions, as well as local history. Here you can admire collections of folk art, ceramics, textiles, furniture, weapons and coins. The Franciscan Monastery dates back to the 14th century and is a special historical and architectural monument. It houses a Gothic church with murals and stained glass, as well as a library including rare manuscripts and incunabula. The monastery is also a cultural and spiritual centre, which organises concerts, exhibitions and conferences.</p>
