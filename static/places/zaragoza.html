	The capital of Aragon has plenty to see in do thanks to two thousand years of history and two cathedrals, one of which the massive Basilica del Pilar is worthy of seeing, if just for its massive size. But the Goya frescos inside are the icing on the cake. There's also a Goya museum where you can see some of his smaller works including etchings.
The Aljafería Palace, the northernmost Muslim palace in Europe is also a big draw along with the Roman remains.</p>
