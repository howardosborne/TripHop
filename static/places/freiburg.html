            <p class="card-text">The city of Freiburg is situated at the edge of the Black Forest and is one of the greenest and sunniest cities in Germany. You can wander around the charming old town with its colourful houses, cobblestone streets and canals, climb up to the Schlossberg hill for a panoramic view of the city and the forest, and take a scenic train ride on the HÃ¶llentalbahn or the Three Lakes Railway</p>
