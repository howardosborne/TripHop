    <p class="card-text">This is the ultimate destination for mountain lovers, as it boasts three of Switzerland's most famous peaks: Eiger, MÃ¶nch, and Jungfrau. You can take a train ride up to the Jungfraujoch, Europe's highest train station at 3454m (11,332ft), and marvel at the views of glaciers and snow-capped mountains. You can also explore the picturesque towns of Grindelwald, Lauterbrunnen, Murren, and Wengen, where you can hike, ski, sled, or zip-line among the majestic scenery.
