	Toulouse, known as 'La Ville Rose', is the proud capital of the Occitan region of France which has had a distinctly independent culture and language - hence its bilingual street signs. Wandering around the city with its rose-coloured bricks, it does feel markedly different from the yellow limestone which dominates so many parts of France.
