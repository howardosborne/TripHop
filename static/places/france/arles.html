	Arles, spiritual capital of Provence, is located where the mighty Rh√¥ne meets the Camargue and was founded by the veterans of Julius Caesar's crack Sixth legion. And while it has world class Roman buildings (that are still in active use today), it's probably more famous for being the place where Vincent Van Gogh came in search of light - the art world hasn't been the same since.
