            <p class="card-text">Lyon, France’s third largest city and reputed gastronomic capital of the world, sits at the junction of the Rhône and Saône rivers. Founded by the Romans, Lyon flourished in the late Middle Ages and has been a major centre for industry, commerce and banking for the last 500 years. The legacy of this wealth is on show through the fine set of buildings.</p>
