	'We’ll always have Paris' - Casablanca
	Ah Paris, where do you start...
	A great thing about switching to low-carbon travel is knowing that over the coming years, we'll pass-through Paris many times. We can cast aside any urge to gulp down Paris in one go and accidentally end up with Paris Syndrome. Instead, it will become an old friend. 
	So, with that in mind, why not pick just one or two things to do on you way through?
