It's been the one of the fastest growing cities in France since the 1990s. As a result, it has very modern districts on the outskirts that are in stark contrast to the old winding roads of the city centre. The town is home to a lot of students due to the presence of the University of Montpellier which has the oldest medical school in Europe, and, as such, Montpellier has a very young feel to it.", "place_longer_desc": "../static/places/montpellier.html", "place_image": "../static/images/montpellier.png", "place_tags": "history", "place_links": "https://www.lonelyplanet.com/search?q=Montpellier", "place_country": "France"}
