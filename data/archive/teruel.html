        'Teruel doesn't exist'

It's a long standing joke that this southern Aragonese city doesn't exist because it's the only provincial capital in the country not to have a direct link to Madrid.

While its renowned for its Jamón de Teruel - serrano ham, it's the Mudejar (moorish) architectue that has made it a world heritage site. The cathedral tower, along with those of San Salvador, San Martín and San Pedro are the jewels of a group of Mudejar monuments declared a World Heritage Site.

But many come to Teruel for love. The story of Juan and Isabel, love dashed leading to tragedy and a pair of tombs with the hands almost touching. The mummified bodies are in glass sided tombs underneath, making the selfies taken by today's star-crossed lovers a tad surreal.

The central Plaza del Torico has a curiously small bull on a large column. Coming from the station also means you get a chance to ascent the ornate Paseo del Oval.
