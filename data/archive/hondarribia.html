        Across the bay from Hendaye and joining on the practical town of Irun, Honarribia is a charming tranquil little resort & port. However the battered town walls reveal a dark past of conflict between the kingdoms of France, Castille and Navarre.

It's a bit nippy in winter and very busy in August with French holidaymakers so Spring and Autumn are perfect.

To help appreciate the town, I'd recommend getting a copy of A Basque Diary by Alex Hallett which recounts her time living in Hondarribia.
