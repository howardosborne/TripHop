        Located in Alt Empordà in northern Catalynya and only 15 km away from the border with France, the village of Llançá has become a popular holiday destination for those seeking peace and quiet.

The town, located 1 km inland to keep away from the prying eyes of pirates, has a nice town square overlooked by the defensive bell tower and parish church of San Vicenç with its curious reworking of the statue of San Vicenç.

Despite having many French visitors, the town seems to be more oriented to Belgium as it has its own mannequin pis.

It's also a nice place to go for a walk along its crinkly coast and see some curious relics from the 1940s.
