        Few places encapsulate the story of Spain as well as Seville. And where better to tell that story than the vast Gothic Cathedral which was built on the site of a Moorish mosque and contains the remains of Christopher Columbus. Next to the Cathedral is it's bell tower, La Giralda, the former minaret of the mosque which you can climb for great views.

Nearby is the Real Alcázar, the former Moorish fort and now a royal palace. In the summer you can visit at night for less heat and more atmosphere. The Alcázar, Cathedral and Archivo de Indias (archive of the colonies in the Americas), have been listed by UNESCO as a 'remarkable monumental complex' which perfectly epitomise the Spanish 'Golden Age'.

The Museo de Bellas Artes offers some of the finest religious works of art with paintings by El Greco, Velázquez, and Goya, but also some more down to earth every day pictures about Seville like Gonzalo Bilbao’s Las cigarreras (The Cigarette Makers). For another place with masterpieces in a building that's also a masterpice in its own right, try the Hospital de los Venerables Sacerdotes.

And if Seville is getting too steamy for you, you could always try cooling off in the Parque de María Luisa. 

Tapas is everywhere and while here, why not try marinated ‘pescaíto’ (fish) or snails accompanied by a fino or manzanilla? And if you want some more direction, here's a guide to some of the finest.

For flamenco try Casa de la Memoria or Casa de la Guitarra and if you are looking for festivals then Semana Santa (Holy Week) and the Feria de Abril (Spring Fair) should do the trick.
