        Vic, capital of Osona region is well worth a visit when spending time in Barcelona or heading to/from France via Latour-de-Carol. 

The town has Roman origins as evidenced by its Roman temple and you can have a journey through the town's history and art at VicPuntZero. However, one of the most notable things about the town is the Cathedral with it's immersive murals by Josep Mar√≠a Sert.

The unusual geography around Vic produces foggy thermal inversions in winter which maybe also helps in the production of the fuet. This thin cured pork sausage, stands in contrast to its more popular cousin, the chorizo by the lack of paprika. If you want to break one of the cardinal foodie rules and find out how sausages are made, fuet-making demonstrations take place here. Ask at the tourist information office for more details.

Each year on the 5th July is the Festa Major with its procession of local giants and human towers. There's also an annual Medieval market that takes place every December in Vic's historic quarter which turns into a Medieval village with crafts, food, drink and street entertainment.
