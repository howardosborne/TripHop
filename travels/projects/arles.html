<p>In February 1888, an artist got off the train at Arles. Over the next year, he produced some of his most famous works of art.

Below is a stroll which takes in most of the van Gogh-related sights and if you want to get a pre-stroll flavour, how about watching this short video of my wander around Arles. A written version, and more useful information, can be found on my Arles hop off page.</p>

<p>I’m not aware of anywhere to put your luggage while you stroll - if you do know of somewhere - let me know, thanks.</p>

<h1 id="strolls">Strolls</h1>
<h2 id="a-wander-around-arles-3k-red">A wander around Arles (3K red)</h2>
<p>Let’s leave Arles station, turn left and walk down Avenue Paulin Talabot to the roundabout which is where Vincent van Gogh lived with Paul Gauguin for an intense few months. The Maison Jaune (Yellow House) has long gone but there is a sign showing where it was and what it looked like - and at least there’s a yellow supermarket nearby.</p>

<p>Walk through the Porte de la Cavalerie with its solid towers and go down Rue de la Cavalerie. At the Amédée Pichot fountain take the left fork along Rue Voltaire and continue  to the impressive arena, (unless you’ve just been to Nimes, in which case the quite impressive arena).</p>

<p>Walk round to the back of the arena and you’ll find the Roman theatre, just a little way up Rue Port de Laure .</p>

<p>From here you could take the extended walk (see below) to see two places that shaped Vincent van Gogh’s work.</p>

<p>Alternatively, take  the Rue de la Calade, which passes in front of the theatre, and continue down this narrow street before taking a left turn down Rue de l’Hôtel de ville to the Place de la Republique and the (rather small) cathedral.</p>

<p>Cross the square and go down Rue Jean Jaurès and take the first right onto Rue de la Rotonde (which continues into Rue Molière). After about 200 meters there is a rather imposing looking building. This was the Hotel Dieu (now L’Espace Van Gogh) - the former hospital where Vincent was treated. Turn right just before the Espace up Place Félix Rey.</p>

<p>The courtyard garden is kept to look as it did when Vincent painted it.</p>

<p>Let’s leave L’Espace Van Gogh and wander through the lanes to another place painted by Vincent.</p>

<p>Continue up Pl. Félix Rey and then turn left onto Rue du Président Wilson. At the end turn left on to Rue de la République and then take the first right onto Rue Frédéric Mistral. At the end turn right onto Rue Barremes and then take the first right onto Rue du Forum which leads to Place du Forum.</p>

<p>Go past the statue of Frederic Mistral - the Nobel laureate and Provencal’s favourite poet and you’ll find a recreation of the iconic ‘Cafe Terrace at Night’ on the opposite side of the square.</p>

<p>The next stop is Fondation Vincent van Gogh, where there’s always one of his paintings together with the works of new artists. Facing ‘Le Café Van Gogh’ go to the left-hand side of the square and take Rue des Thermes. At the end turn left onto Rue du Dr Fanton and the Fondation is 100 metres up the street on your left.</p>

<p>After you have finished there, continue along Rue du Dr Fanton until you have reached the banks of the Rhone. I have marked a slightly more wiggly route on the map if you want to look around some more of the back alleys.</p>

<p>Turn right and wander along the banks of the River Rhone and see if you can spot where Vincent painted La Nuit Étoilée (starry night) picture.</p>

<p>Carry on along the banks until you reach the remains of the grand two lion railway bridge and the road to the station is on your right.</p>

<h2 id="alyscamps-extended-walk-1k-purple">Alyscamps extended walk (1K purple)</h2>
<p>There are two sites that help bring van Gogh’s time in Arles to life. Let’s start where we left off at the Roman theatre.</p>

<p>Head down the Rue du Cloître. There’s a footpath through to the park on the left just before the archway, but if it’s closed for any reason you can always follow the road around to the front entrance to the park.</p>

<p>Vincent used to visit and paint in the Jardin d’été, getting inspiration from nature (and the people who promenaded). Signs have been put up at the key places along with a map, so it’s easy to take yourself on a tour and try to match up what Vincent painted with what you can see now.</p>

<p>Vincent also visited another public space, with an long history, which you can visit next. Leave the park at the far end and turn right down the Avenue des Alyscamps - but before you do take a peek left to see one of the towers that made up the city walls (Tour Morgue). Follow the Avenue down the hill and to the left, or follow the canal path if you prefer. At the end is the Alyscamps, the Roman necropolis.</p>

<p>When Gauguin arrived in Arles to stay with Vincent, this is where they first went to paint.</p>

<p>When you have finished here, you can either retrace your steps and pick up the red trail at the Roman Theatre, or walk a further 5km to the van Gogh bridge (green route on map)</p>

<h2 id="van-gogh-bridge-extended-walk-5km-green">van Gogh bridge extended walk (5km green)</h2>
<p>If you want to see one of the iconic little swing bridges Vincent painted, you may want to follow this extra extention to a re-creation of the bridge that featured in his pictures. Unfortunately the originals have now all gone.</p>

<p>With the Alyscamps behind go left down the disused train track. Once you’ve crossed the canal turn left down the slope, go over both crossings and down Rue Jean Charcot (which merges into Rue Gaspard Monge) with the canal on your left. After about 1.5 km you’ll come to the bridge.</p>

<p>Then retrace your steps.</p>
