<p>It’s been the capital of wine for centuries and that has lead to some pretty imressive building. Sounds like it’s worth a wander…

<p>If you are short of time, this route will allow you to catch a glimpse of Bordeaux and sample the food and drink that makes the place tick.</p>

<p>Leave the station and follow the road to the right (Rue Saint-Vincent-de-Paul) which leads on to Cours de la Marne.</p>

<p>Around 500 metres along the road is the former Zoological Institue to the left, which is now a hotel where you can pick up a drink in the bar and sup it, taking in the views from the rooftop terrace. One site you can’t see from the rooftop terrace is Place Andre Meunier, which is on the other side of the road and used to be the site of municipal abattoirs.</p>

<p>After another 500 metres along Cours de la Marne on the right is the Place des Capucins which contains the Marche des Capucins - a good place to check out the local produce, sample some oysters or maybe pick up a Puits d’Amour.</p>

<p>Walk through the market and head for the tall spire down Rue Clare and then Rue Gaspard Philippe.</p>

<p>The spire belongs to Saint-Michel Basilica and there’s a market here every Monday and Saturday morning. Mummified bodies used to be displayed in the crypt but were moved elsewhere in 1979.</p>

<p>Around the back of the church, Rue des Allamandiers leads to the Saint-Michel sports fields which have the UNESCO listed river front as a backdrop.</p>

<p>Walk back through the the archway of the Porte de la Monnaie onto Rue Carpenteyre and then turn left down Rue Camille Sauvageau which leads to Eglise Saint-Croix. Behind it is the Bordeaux Conservatoire for fine arts.</p>

<p>Continue on to Rue de Tauzia which will take you all the way back to the station.</p>

<h2 id="a-wander-around-town-5k-blue">A wander around town (5k blue)</h2>
<p>Leave the station and follow the road to the right (Rue Saint-Vincent-de-Paul) which leads on to Cours de la Marne.</p>

<p>Around 500 metres along the road is the former Zoological Institue to the left, which is now a hotel where you can pick up a drink in the bar and sup it, taking in the views from the rooftop terrace.

<p>After another 500 metres along Cours de la Marne on the right is the Place des Capucins which contains the Marche des Capucins - a good place to check out the local produce, sample some oysters or maybe pick up a Puits d’Amour.</p>

<p>Tummy filled, let’s continue along Cours de la Marne which opens out on the Place de la Victoire containing Colonne de la Vigne et du Vin - a nod to where the city’s great wealth came from. Also, check out the giant tortoise next to the column.</p>

<p>Go through the grand Porte d’Aquitaine and head down the renowned shopping street, Rue Sainte Catherine.</p>

<p>The road is crossed by road with tram tracks. A this point turn left and go down Cours d’Alsace-et-Lorraine</p>

<p>This will take you to the cathedral and past the Pey Berland tower, which you can climb for some great views. A little further down the road is the Fort du Hâ, a 14th Century remnant of the town’s fortifications, which was turned into a jail and is now the national school for judges.</p>

<p>Go back towards the cathedral and in between the cathedral and the Hotel de Ville</p>

<p>Follow the cathedral round.</p>

<p>The statue of the bloke in a long coat is wartime resistance bigwig, local mayor and prime minister, Jacques ‘Chaban’ Delmas.</p>

<p>Turn left down Rue du Père Louis Jabrun and then right on to Rue des Trois-Conils, which will give you a chance to empty your pockets some more before reaching Place Camile Jullian.</p>

<p>Turn left on to Rue du Pas-Saint-Georges and follow road past Place du Parlement to reach the impressively spacious Place de la Bourse. For a unique view, we need to cross the tram tracks. and head for the river. However, watch where you’re walking or you’ll spoil your shoes and someone’s perfect instagram shot. The shallow water is a giant mirror!</p>

<p>At the river bank, turn right and follow the course of the river to fully take in the UNESCO-listed world heritage view.</p>

<p>Go through Porte Cailhau on the right - it was probably designed to be imposing - it’s just the surrounding buildings that make it seem cute.</p>

<p>Turn left down Rue Ausone which leads to a statue/bust of the 4th Century Romana and is in from of the Frog and Rosbif pub. Turn right on to Rue de la Prte Saint-Jean and then left on the Rue de la Rouselle which will take you past Porte de Bourgogne on your left.</p>

<p>Continue straight on (Rue des Ponets) and at the end of that road, turn right on to Rue Maubec which leads to Place Maynard containing Saint-Michael basilica.</p>

<p>Cross over the square and turn right down Rue des Allamandiers and then left on to Rue Camille Sauvageau. At the end of this street is Place Renaudel containing the pleasingly asymmetric church of Saint Croix church, which was the parish church of the village which has been consumed by Bordeaux. Behind it is the Bordeaux Conservatoire for fine arts.</p>

<p>Continue on to Rue de Tauzia which will take you all the way back to the station.</p>
